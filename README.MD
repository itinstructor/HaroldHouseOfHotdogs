# Harold's House of Hotdogs

Harold's House of Hotdogs is an Agile development assignment for Computer Science 1 at [Western Nebraska Community College](https://www.wncc.edu). 

This project is designed to learn more about the following concepts.

**Version control**, also known as source control, is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code. Version control systems are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time. One popular and open source system is [git](https://git-scm.com/).

**Agile development** is an iterative, collaborative approach to software development that emphasizes flexibility, customer collaboration, and incremental progress. It promotes breaking down complex projects into smaller, manageable tasks, allowing teams to adapt to changing requirements and priorities. Agile methodologies, such as Scrum or Kanban, prioritize customer feedback, continuous improvement, and regular communication.
